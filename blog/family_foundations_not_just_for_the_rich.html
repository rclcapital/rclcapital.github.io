<h1>Family Foundations Not Just For The Rich</h1>
<h3>Your last name does not need to be Rockefeller in order to benefit from a family foundation.</h3>
<p>When most people hear the word Foundation they immediately think of families such as Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie.&nbsp; However, more than 60% of foundations have less than $1 million in assets.&nbsp; With the number of foundations doubling between 1990 and 2005, it is reasonable to assume that families with assets significantly less than that of the Carnegie�s are forming the majority of new foundations.
</p>
<p>
The two general types of foundations are either private or public.&nbsp; The primary distinction is that private foundations generally receive donations from a single source while a public foundation receives donations from multiple sources.&nbsp; A popular form of a private foundation is a family foundation where a family member will contribute assets to the family foundation and can then be managed by their heirs long after they are gone.&nbsp; The subsequent family members who manage the foundation can also receive compensation for their efforts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The family foundation makes sense when a family is charitably inclined and has a strong motive to give.&nbsp; One of the many benefits is that forming a family foundation will encourage your family members to communicate, if for no other reason, about how and to whom distributions should be given.&nbsp; Typically, the foundation will distribute a specified percentage of the assets; say 5%, each year.&nbsp; If the assets grow on average 8% annually, the excess 3% remains in the foundation and results in a larger pool of assets going forward.&nbsp; On average, the pool of assets from which distributions will be 3% larger each year resulting in a larger pool of assets that can be used to benefit charitable causes for generations to come.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
An initial deterrent for many families from establishing a family foundation is that the assets will not be available to leave to their heirs upon their death.&nbsp; The solution to this potential problem is simply to buy enough life insurance that can be distributed to your heirs upon your passing.&nbsp; Many times, the tax benefits more than offset the value of assets contributed to the foundation resulting in your heirs actually receiving more, while at the same time contributing a sum of money to the foundation.&nbsp; In other words, one plus one does equal three � sometimes.&nbsp; Another deterrent is the perceived cost of establishing a foundation.&nbsp; Historically, significant costs have meant that it was not cost-effective to form a foundation unless you had millions of dollars to contribute.&nbsp; However, companies have formed in recent years that provide turnkey services for individuals interested in forming family foundations that are relatively inexpensive.&nbsp; The result is that foundations are now being formed with as little as $100,000.
</p>
<p>
If you can leave the same amount of money to your heirs and, at the same time, contribute money to a foundation that can be used to benefit society for future generations, is this not worth considering?&nbsp; Consider your charitable interests, family interests and personal tax situation.&nbsp; For many of you, a family foundation is excellent opportunity to positively impact the world long after you are gone.&nbsp;
