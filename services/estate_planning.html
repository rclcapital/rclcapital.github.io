<h1>Estate Planning</h1>
<h3>You've worked hard to accumulate your assets. We can help ensure they're eventually passed to the persons of your choosing, not the government.</h3>
<p>We can help you can use existing tax laws to maximize the assets which stay within your family and the charitable organizations of your choosing.
</p>
<p>
We'll review your will, how your assets are titled (jointly, individually, etc.) and your beneficiary designations, and discuss potential tools that can be used to pass your estate to your heirs.
</p>
<p>
We'll also work with your attorney to ensure that any recommendations fulfill the required legal standards of your particular state.
</p>
<p>
With a little planning, you can decide not only who receives your assets, but also how much they receive and how they are used ... even after you are gone.
