<h1>IRA and 401(k) Rollovers </h1>
<h3>Effective rollovers consist of two components - knowledge of the options available and the subsequent investment of the assets to take advantage of the numerous available options.</h3>

<p>Individual Retirement Accounts and 401(k) plan assets have one distinct advantage not generally available for many other investment vehicles and that is the deferral of income tax on the earnings until the assets are withdrawn or avoided completely in the case of Roth IRA assets.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, it is critically important that the proper procedures are followed in order to protect the preferential tax treatment by the IRS. RCL Capital will ensure that all assets are rolled over properly so that income taxes are not paid prematurely.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, leaving 401(k) assets in previous employer plans does not take advantage of the significant number of attractive investment options if the assets are rolled over into an IRA.
</p>
<p>
Many investors leave their assets in an old employer�s plan simply because they do not know what to do with the money. Generally, it is not to your advantage to leave your assets in a 401(k) plan when those assets can be rolled over into an IRA with thousands of options available.
</p>
<p>
RCL Capital help you explore the options and pick the one that is most advantageous for you and your long-term financial success.&nbsp; We look forward to working with you to effectively transition your IRA and 401(k) assets.
